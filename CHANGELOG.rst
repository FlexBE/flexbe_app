* reverting nw.js to last known-to-work version
  From nw.js 0.42.4, the import/export configuration functionality throws an "Invalid calling page. This function can't be called from a background page." error. This has been reported for nw.js already on https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/7349.
  Hence, the import/export functionality is currently unusable with nw.js >0.42.3 as integrated in b93078fd6705445bf6183af40598619243800b1e.

  The Python state parsing feature introduced in 4f20227ef900ca32e78414c190fb464d964666e5 used to crash when no docstring is provided in a state definition, hence stalling the parsing procedure. This commit returns the default label "[no documentation]" on a missing docstring.
